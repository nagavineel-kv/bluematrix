###### Blue Matrix

Blue Matrix is a complete Project Management Dashboard built with modern full-stack technologies and AWS services. The frontend uses Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI Data Grid for a responsive, dynamic UI. Redux Toolkit and RTK Query are used for state management and efficient data fetching. The backend is powered by Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for database handling and PgAdmin for monitoring. The application also integrates AWS Lambda for serverless functions and AWS Cognito for secure user authentication.
